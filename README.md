# Visual Representation of GHMC Covid-19 Cases

The <a href="https://www.ghmc.gov.in/covid_details.aspx#">GHMC Covid Details</a> website just provided a database dump of the Covid-19 cases in the Greater Hyderabad area. This project aims to use that data to display some useful graphs. Built using Angular and charts.js.

<strong>Update:</strong> They kept making breaking changes to their site, so this project is no longer being maintained.
